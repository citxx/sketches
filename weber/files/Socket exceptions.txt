socket:
m           EACCES             Permission to create a socket of the specified type and/or protocol is denied.
m           EAFNOSUPPORT       The implementation does not support the specified address family.
dev         EINVAL             Unknown protocol, or protocol family not available.
dev         EINVAL             Invalid flags in type.
m           EMFILE             Process file table overflow.
m           ENFILE             The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
m           ENOBUFS or ENOMEM  Insufficient memory is available.  The socket cannot be created until sufficient resources are freed.
dev         EPROTONOSUPPORT    The protocol type or the specified protocol is not supported within this domain.

bind:
m           EACCES             The address is protected, and the user is not the superuser.
m           EADDRINUSE         The given address is already in use.
dev         EBADF              sockfd is not a valid descriptor.
dev         EINVAL             The socket is already bound to an address.
dev         ENOTSOCK           sockfd is a descriptor for a file, not a socket.

listen:
m           EADDRINUSE         Another socket is already listening on the same port.
dev         EBADF              The argument sockfd is not a valid descriptor.
dev         ENOTSOCK           The argument sockfd is not a socket.
dev         EOPNOTSUPP         The socket is not of a type that supports the listen() operation.

accept:
dev         EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK   The  socket  is marked nonblocking and no connections are present to be accepted.
dev         EBADF              The descriptor is invalid.
            ECONNABORTED       A connection has been aborted.
dev         EFAULT             The addr argument is not in a writable part of the user address space.
retry       EINTR              The system call was interrupted by a signal that was caught before a valid connection arrived.
dev         EINVAL             Socket is not listening for connections, or addrlen is invalid (e.g., is negative).
m           EMFILE             The per-process limit of open file descriptors has been reached.
m           ENFILE             The system limit on the total number of open files has been reached.
m           ENOBUFS, ENOMEM    Not enough free memory.  This often means that the memory allocation is limited by the socket buffer limits, not by the system memory.
dev         ENOTSOCK           The descriptor references a file, not a socket.
dev         EOPNOTSUPP         The referenced socket is not of type SOCK_STREAM.
